# Predicting-sarcasm-LSTM

The Sarcasm Detection in Newspaper Headlines project employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict sarcasm in news headlines. 
In an era where discerning the tone of textual information is crucial, this project addresses the challenge of identifying sarcastic elements within news headlines with precision and efficiency.

Key Features and Techniques:

LSTM Architecture:
Leveraging the power of LSTM networks, the model captures contextual dependencies and long-range dependencies within sequences, making it well-suited for understanding the nuanced language used in newspaper headlines.

Word Embeddings:
The model utilizes pre-trained word embeddings to represent words in a continuous vector space. This enhances the semantic understanding of words and helps the model discern subtle linguistic cues indicative of sarcasm.

Sequential Analysis:
Given the sequential nature of language, the LSTM model excels in analyzing the order and arrangement of words in headlines. It considers the sequential dependencies between words, a critical aspect in deciphering sarcasm.

Contextual Features:
The model extracts contextual features, such as word order, sentiment, and syntactic structures, to discern sarcastic nuances that often rely on subtle linguistic cues and the overall context of the headline.
